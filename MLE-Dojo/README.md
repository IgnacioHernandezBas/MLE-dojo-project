# MLE-Dojo Dependency

This directory contains the cloned MLE-Dojo repository, which serves as a dependency for the agent.

## Setup

To clone the MLE-Dojo repository:

```bash
cd MLE-Dojo
git clone https://github.com/MLEDojo/mle-dojo.git .
```

Or from the parent directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MLEDojo/mle-dojo.git MLE-Dojo/
```

## Note

Treat this as a read-only dependency. All custom agent code should be placed in the `../agent/` directory.
